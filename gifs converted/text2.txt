This is how many stories begin. Eventually the blood smeared image in the snow becomes a wish and the wish becomes a daughter but the mother dies in childbirth and the father remarries an insecure and jealous woman who banishes the miracle child into the forest like many step mothers in many stories have done. The rest of the story follows the daughters journey for survival in the forest and her reunion with the father. The dead mother, is forgotten. She is literally dead and gone. But what if the birthing mother who dies in childbirth, buried under the earth grows into a tree. A sacred tree like the tree of life, that extends beyond this story and even this world.
