I am the tree of life. I stand between Earth and sky, bridging this world and the hereafter. Sometimes I offer immortality, sometimes wisdom, sometimes boons, sometimes answers. If you think of any ancient culture anywhere in the world, they know about this symbol and what it stands for. How is that so? Not all answers come quick and easy, for some you have to stay a little while longerâ€¦
